                Some people call him the King of The Dinosaurs. T-Rex was one of the best hunters of all timeâ€¦ all the other dinosaurs

                A T-Rex was about 13 feet tall (taller than your parents!), weighed about 9 tons (almost as much a school bus), and
                could run almost as fast as a deer!
